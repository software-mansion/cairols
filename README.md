# CairoLS

CairoLS is an implementation of [Language Server Protocol][LSP] for the [Cairo] language.
Cairo is the first Turing-complete language for creating provable programs for general computation.

## Quick start

CairoLS is distributed along the [Scarb] package manager.
To get started, install Scarb and the Cairo extension for your editor.

For Visual Studio Code, install
the [Cairo for Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=starkware.cairo1)
from the marketplace.

For other editors that support LSP,
you can point the editor to the `scarb cairo-language-server` command to start the server.
