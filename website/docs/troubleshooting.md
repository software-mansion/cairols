# Troubleshooting

If you stumble upon some unexpected behaviour or your Language Server / VSC extension not working, please make sure you first check those steps below.

1. Check whether you are using the latest version of [Scarb package manager](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/).
2. If you are using the [Visual Studio Code Cairo](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=starkware.cairo1) extension, check for any updates.
3. Check the settings of the Visual Studio Code extension, and make sure they align with your current use case.
4. Also for Visual Studio Code, you can check for any errors inside the Output of the Cairo Language Server extension.

If none of the above resolves the issue, please create an issue [here](https://github.com/software-mansion/cairols/issues/new/choose), or contact us via [Telegram channel](https://t.me/cairo_ls_support).
